# DMS - Dealership Management Scripts

This project contains a small C++ console application that was originally
created during the CDK cyberattack in June 2024.  It was a stopgap solution
used to keep parts operations running when the dealership's primary systems were
offline.

The program allows parts employees to look up inventory, generate quotes,
create invoices and basic repair orders.  All information is saved to plain text
files so the data can be accessed even without network connectivity.

## Features

- **Inventory lookup** – search the inventory file for a part number to display
  its description, bin location and pricing.
- **Invoice creation** – generate an invoice text file and automatically
  increment the invoice number stored in the configuration file.
- **Quote creation** – create a quote text file which can later be rolled into a
  repair order.
- **Stock check** – quickly check pricing or add parts that are not already in
  the inventory database.

## Configuration

Application settings are stored in `config/config.txt`.  Lines beginning with
`#` contain key/value pairs wrapped in quotes.  The following keys are used:

```
#filename       "input_data.txt"   # Inventory data filename
#filename_path  "C:\"              # Location of the inventory file
#billed_path    "C:\Billed"        # Where invoice text files are written
#quoted_path    "C:\Quoted"        # Where quote text files are written
#invoice_number "1000"             # Starting invoice number
#quote_number   "1000"             # Starting quote number
```

Adjust these paths to match where you want files created on your system.

## Building

The program is a single source file.  It can be compiled with any modern C++
compiler.  For example with `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o dms main.cpp
```

## Running

Run the compiled program from a terminal:

```bash
./dms
```

You will be prompted for your employee number and then shown a menu with the
available modes:

```
(Q)uote | (R)epair Order | (I)nvoice | (S)tock Check | (E)xit
```

All documents generated by the program (invoices, quotes, etc.) are stored in
the directories specified in `config/config.txt`.

## Inventory File Format

The inventory file (`input_data.txt` by default) stores one part per line using
tab-separated values enclosed in quotes.  For example:

```
"123-123-12-12" "BIN 2" "PART DESCRIPTION" "1"
```

You can extend this file with additional parts as needed.
